## 📦 What's Been Built

### 1. **Core Voice Agent** ✅
- **File:** `src/main.py`
- Natural conversation AI (GPT-5-CHAT)
- Voice-to-text and text-to-voice (Azure Speech)
- Text mode and voice mode for testing
- Interactive menu system

### 2. **Senior Profile Management** ✅
- **File:** `src/services/profile_service.py`
- **CLI Tool:** `src/manage_profiles.py`
- **Database:** Cosmos DB `conversations/seniors` container
- Complete senior records with:
  - Personal info (name, phone, DOB)
  - Emergency contacts
  - Medical conditions and medications
  - Call history tracking
  - Health metrics (vitals)
  - Safety alert tracking
  - Cognitive baseline scores

### 3. **Comprehensive Safety System** ✅
- **Files:** `src/senior_health_prompt.py`, `src/services/safety_service.py`
- **Documentation:** `SAFETY.md`
- **10 Safety Guardrail Categories:**
  1. No medical advice
  2. No harmful suggestions
  3. No financial advice
  4. Anti-manipulation protections
  5. Abuse/neglect detection
  6. Emergency response protocols
  7. Autonomy respect
  8. Privacy protection
  9. Mental health crisis handling
  10. Medication safety

- **Real-time Monitoring:**
  - Emergency medical detection
  - Suicide risk detection
  - Abuse indicators (physical, emotional, financial)
  - Neglect detection
  - Medication issues
  - Harmful AI advice blocking

### 4. **Topic Control** ✅
- AI stays focused on health monitoring
- Polite redirection for off-topic conversations
- Prevents politics, finance, tech support, etc.
- Maintains 5-10 minute call structure

### 5. **Data Architecture** ✅
**Cosmos DB Database: `conversations`**
- **Container 1: `sessions`** - Conversation transcripts
- **Container 2: `seniors`** - Senior profiles

**Redis Cache:**
- Active session state
- Fast lookups

## 🔒 Safety Features in Action

### Example: Emergency Detection

**User says:** "I'm having chest pain"

**System Response:**
```
============================================================
🚨 EMERGENCY DETECTED - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
============================================================
Recommended Action: CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY - Medical emergency detected

Crisis Resources:
  - emergency: 911 for immediate life-threatening emergencies
  - suicide_crisis: 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline
  - elder_abuse: 1-800-677-1116
============================================================
```

**AI Says:** "This is an emergency. I need you to call 911 right now. Can you do that for me?"

**Saved to Database:** Alert logged with EMERGENCY level in session metadata

---

### Example: Abuse Detection

**User says:** "My caregiver hit me yesterday"

**System Response:**
```
⚠️ SAFETY ALERT: URGENT
Categories: abuse_physical
Recommended Action: ABUSE ALERT - Contact Adult Protective Services
Matched 1 concerning pattern(s)
```

**AI Says:** "What you're describing concerns me. You deserve to be safe and treated with respect. Would it be okay if someone who can help reached out to you?"

**Saved to Database:** Urgent alert in senior profile's safetyAlerts array

---

### Example: Off-Topic Redirect

**User says:** "What do you think about the election?"

**AI Says:** "I'm here to focus on your health and wellbeing. How are you feeling today?"
